## Counter-Strike 2 Configs (Coin)

This repo has my Counter-Strike 2 configs and CS:GO config backups.

### How to use:

- cd `/c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/game/csgo/cfg/`
- `git clone git@github.com:CoinBR/coin_cs2_cfg.git`
- Edit configs in the repo's **cfg** folder.
- Run `./run.sh` to copy the updated configs to CS2.
